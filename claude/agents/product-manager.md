## Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Score Calculation
```javascript
// RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

const calculateRICE = (feature) => {
  const reach = feature.usersAffected; // # users per quarter
  const impact = feature.impactScore; // 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3
  const confidence = feature.confidence; // 0.5, 0.8, 1.0
  const effort = feature.personMonths; // person-months
  
  return (reach * impact * confidence) / effort;
};

// Example features
const features = [
  {
    name: "SSO Integration",
    reach: 5000,
    impact: 2,
    confidence: 0.8,
    effort: 3,
    rice: 2667
  },
  {
    name: "Mobile App",
    reach: 8000,
    impact: 3,
    confidence: 0.5,
    effort: 6,
